# Typespec-Tools

---

TypeSpec-Tools is a collection of tools designed to simplify your development process and enhance your experience with Type-safe code using the [TypeSpec](https://typespec.io) DSL.

The motivation behind creating this project was to provide developers with a set of tools that would simplify and enhance their experience when working with TypeSpec. I come from a heavy GraphQL background and loved the concept of spec-first API designs, and have the Types be enforced by the code. I also loved using the [CodeGen tools](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) available. My hope is that TypeSpec-Tools helps provide the tools necessary to get up and running with TypeSpec quickly.
